I've studied cell and molecular biology with an additional focus on microbiology and evolutionary biology. I'm currently conducting my master thesis at Aaron Vogan’s lab in collaboration with Lars Behrendt’s lab and Anna Rosling’s lab. My work is concerned with yeast evolution and domestication, specifically beer-fermenting yeast. For example, I’m trying to “resurrect” and sequence ancient strains of yeast from museum items historically used in beer brewing. I enjoy working both in the wet and dry lab and my passion for biology is broad. For example, in my bachelor thesis I studied insect physiology and genetics. Additionally, I have an interest in language and writing, and I have taken additional university courses in English language structure, linguistics, and academic writing.
